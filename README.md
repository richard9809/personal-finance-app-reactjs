## Overview

### The challenge

The app allows users to manage their personal finances with a variety of features:

- Overview page showing all data at-a-glance
- Transactions page with pagination and options to search, sort, and filter
- CRUD operations for budgets and saving pots
- Viewing progress toward saving goals
- Adding and withdrawing money from saving pots
- Managing recurring bills with sorting and searching options
- Navigation and actions accessible via keyboard
- Responsive design adaptable to various screen sizes

## My process

### Built with

- React - For interactive UI
- Styled Components - For component-level styling
- CSS Grid and Flexbox - For layout
- JavaScript - For dynamic interactions
- React Router - For navigation
- LocalStorage and Context API - For data persistence

### What I learned

Working on this project enhanced my understanding of React hooks, state management, and building accessible web applications. Here are some highlights:

- State Management: Used Reactâ€™s state management effectively for data handling in CRUD operations across various components.
- Pagination and Filtering: Implemented custom pagination logic to load transactions in batches and efficient filtering for user convenience.
- Responsive Design: Employed CSS Grid and Flexbox for a mobile-first, responsive layout.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
const totalPages = Math.ceil(sortedTransactions.length / transactionsPerPage);
const currentTransactions = sortedTransactions.slice(
  (currentPage - 1) * transactionsPerPage,
  currentPage * transactionsPerPage
);
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to focus more on:

- Backend Integration: Expanding this app to a full-stack application by connecting a backend for persistent data storage.
- Improving Performance: Optimizing data handling and load times with caching strategies.
- Advanced State Management: Implementing Redux or Context API for more complex data flows in larger applications.
